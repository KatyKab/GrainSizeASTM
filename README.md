# GrainSizeASTM
Based on ASTM Standard Test Methods for Determining Average Grain Size
The size and location of grains in a microstructure are normally completely random. No nominally random process of positioning a test pattern can improve this randomness, but random processes can yield poor representation by concentrating measurements in part of a specimen. Representative implies that all parts of the specimen contribute to the result, not, as sometimes has been presumed, that fields of average grain size are selected.
